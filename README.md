## Abstract  

China experiences large variations in influenza seasonal activity. We aim to improve the current understanding of the geographic and within-year variations of influenza to provide evidence for the optimisation of healthcare strategies. We searched English and Chinese databases for articles reporting time-series data on four influenza-related outcomes at the sub-national and sub-annual level. After synthesizing the data, we reported on the mean monthly rate, epidemic onset, duration, peak and intensity across China. Intra-year influenza patterns varied across China, particularly in relation to latitude and geographic location. High-latitude provinces were characterised by having short and intense annual winter epidemics, whilst most mid-latitude and low-latitude provinces experienced semi-annual epidemics or year-round activity. Subtype activity varied across the country, with A/H1N1pdm09 and influenza B occurring predominantly in the winter, whereas A/H3N2 activity exhibited a latitudinal divide with high-latitude regions experiencing a winter peak, whilst mid and low-latitude regions experienced a summer epidemic. Epidemic onsets and peaks also varied, occurring first in the northwest and later in the southeast. Our results have implications for the optimisation of immunisation programmes and healthcare provision, supporting the need for regional based approaches to address variations in local epidemiology.
